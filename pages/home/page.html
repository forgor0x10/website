  <p>
    I'm a russian loser who likes making games and music (both suck). I make
    games mostly on Godot 4, although I've been trying to make my own C++
    engine. My other projects also include some small CLI and web apps.

    I use Windows 10 because I can't bother migrating to a different OS. MSYS2
    is all you need.
